#Half adealist, but no cynical. 

My name is Hongchao Qin(秦宏超). I'm a Ph.D. candidate in computer software and theory in Northeastern University, China, under the supervision of Prof. Guoren Wang and Prof. Ye Yuan. I obtained the Master Degree of Computer Science and the Bachelor Degree of Mathematics in Northeastern University, China at 2015 and 2013.

Now I'm working as a research assistant at Singapore Management University, under the supervision of Prof. Feida Zhu.

##Research Interests
 - Clustering and Community Detection in Social Networks
 - Pattern Match and Recommendation in Social Networks

##Publications
- Qin H., Yuan Y., Zhu F., Wang G. (2016) Efficient Community Maintenance for Dynamic Social Networks. In: Li F., Shim K., Zheng K., Liu G. (eds) Web Technologies and Applications. APWeb 2016. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 9932. Springer, Cham


##Project
- Community Detection in Dynamic Social Networks:
The traditional community detection algorithms define an objective function Q which can measure the quality of the communities. Once the graph changes, we must re- compute the function Q to detect new communities of the whole graph. To solve this problem, we propose a novel community detection algorithm in dynamic social networks. When the graph changes, we can re-compute the communities by analyzing the function Q. Then we can update the communities by the vertices and edges which are changed during graph evolution.

- From Mar 2011 to May 2012, I'm a team leader of the National College Students’ Innovative Training Program of China. We create software for students and teachers to take mathematics courses online intelligently.

##Awards
- The Meritorious Winner Award of the Mathematical Contest in Modeling, 2012, sponsored by SIAM, the NSA, and INFORMS.   
- The Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award of Northeastern University, 2013
